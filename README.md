# Calculator
Calculator application created with Java **Swing**. It is simple with easy code to help people understand how a calculator works through codes, and how to create one using java
##
This project is intended to be simple, so the calculator is in a single class to facilitate understanding. It can do the four main calculations, but I didn't add calculations with negative numbers or other types. Feel free to contribute if you think it's important.
